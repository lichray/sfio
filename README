This directory contains the following:

Standard directories:
	./bin
	./lib
	./man
	./include

Package directories:
	./src/lib/sfio
	./src/lib/vthread

Before building a package, you should change your shell PATH variable
to include "./bin" so that the program "iffe" would be available
in your search path. Iffe (IF Features Exist) is a language interpreter
to execute specifications that define configuration parameters.
In this way, a software package can automatically configure itself
to take advantage of local features in implementing its operations.
Each package keeps Iffe scripts in a subdirectory "features".

After resetting PATH, you can change directory to a package directory
and run "make" to build the package. There is a README file in each
package directory that tells more about the local directory hierarchy.

Let me know of any problems. Good luck and have fun.
